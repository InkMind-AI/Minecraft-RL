## Action Space
You can choose different output action formats. For example, you may use a hierarchical format, which includes both a grounding-level action and a raw action; or a motion-level format along with a raw action. You can also choose to output only the raw action directly.
The action spaces for each level are as follows:
### grounding actions
* Kill <|object_ref_start|>mob<|object_ref_end|><|point_start|>(x,y)<|point_end|> # Kill the Minecraft mobs.
* Mine <|object_ref_start|>block<|object_ref_end|><|point_start|>(x,y)<|point_end|> # Destroy the Minecraft blocks.
* Approach <|object_ref_start|>object<|object_ref_end|><|point_start|>(x,y)<|point_end|> # approach to the target object.
* right click <|point_start|>(x,y)<|point_end|> # use the right lick button to interact with the object.
* move to <|point_start|>(x,y)<|point_end|> # Move the cursor in the GUI to the location of the object.
* no-op 
###motion action 
* move <direction> 
* sprint 
* sneak 
* turn <direction> 
* cursor move <direction> 
* jump 
* drop 
* swap 
* switch hotbar 
* open inventory 
* close inventory 
* close gui 
* attack / mine 
* place / use 
* operate gui 
* choose
### raw actions
* move('dx', 'dy') # Move the mouse position; dx and dy represent horizontal and vertical movement, respectively.
* click('left' or 'right')) # left click or right click the mouse
    - left_click # Attack; In GUI, pick up the stack of items or place the stack of items in a GUI cell; when used as a double click (attack - no attack - attack sequence), collect all items of the same kind present in inventory as a single stack.
    - right_click # Place the item currently held or use the block the player is looking at. In GUI, pick up the stack of items or place a single item from a stack held by mouse.
* press(keys) # press the keyboard buttons
    - 'w' # forward W key Move forward.
    - 's' # Move backward.
    - 'a' # Strafe left.
    - 'd' # Strafe right.
    - 'e' # Open or close inventory and the 2x2 crafting grid.
    - 'space' # Jump.
    - 'q' # Drop a single item from the stack of items the player is currently holding. If the player presses ctrl-Q then it drops the entire stack. In the GUI, the same thing happens except to the item the mouse is hovering over.\n       - '1'-'9' # Switch active item to the one in a given hotbar cell.
    - 'left.control' # Move fast in the current direction of motion.
    - 'left.shift' # Move carefully in current direction of motion. In the GUI it acts as a modifier key: when used with attack it moves item from/to the inventory to/from the hotbar, and when used with craft it crafts the maximum number of items possible instead of just 1.
* no_op # wait and do not interact with the world
If multiple actions are activated, use and connect.
## Continuously take action until the task is completed. 
Wrap your hierarchical action inside Skill: skill actions \nGrounding: grounding actions \nMotion: motion actions \nAction: raw actions
